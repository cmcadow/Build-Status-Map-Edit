# Build-Status-Map-Edit
Hey Alex,

Here is the code you asked for. I decided to challenge myself and try some stuff I haven't really played around with in college yet, and while I'm happy I learned a lot of backend & frontend integration, I unfortunately ran into some errors and wasn't able to get the entire thing done in a satisfactory way. I would love to hear your comments, critiques, and overall thoughts as soon as you can! Thanks again for this awesome opportunity!

How to run: 

The backend is made in python and meant to be run in Flask, when in Flask enter:
python app.py

Additonally, the front end is made in javascript and was made to be run in React. Create a new React app and replace 'App.js' with 'npm start' without the 's and then run.

It seems the errors I was running into was within the update_status' method. I tried super hard not to get other's or online help in order to showcase my own skill, and I would love your help to debug whenever possible. Thanks again.

 - Charlie
